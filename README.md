## Test your React Components with Nightwatch and Testing Library

More details on the [@nightwatch/testing-library](https://github.com/nightwatchjs/nightwatch-testing-library) repo.

Step-by-step tutorial available at: https://nightwatchjs.org/blog/test-your-react-components-with-nightwatch-and-testing-library/

The text covers how to:

1. set up a new React project with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which is also what Nightwatch uses internally for component testing;
2. install and configure Nightwatch and Testing Library;
3. mock API requests using the `@nightwatch/api-testing` plugin;
4. write a complex React component test using Nightwatch and Testing Library.
