## Test your React Components with Nightwatch and Testing Library

Step-by-step tutorial available at: https://blog.nightwatchjs.org/  

The text covers how to:

1. set up a new React project with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which is also what Nightwatch uses internally for component testing;
2. install and configure Nightwatch and Testing Library;
3. mock API requests using the `@nightwatch/api-testing` plugin;
4. write a complex React component test using Nightwatch and Testing Library.
